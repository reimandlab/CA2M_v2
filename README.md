# Predicting regional mutation burden in cancer genomes using chromatin accessibility (CA) and replication timing (RT)

This repository includes source code, tutorials, and processed datasets for the study: 

_Chromatin accessibility of primary human cancers ties regional mutational processes and signatures with tissues of origin_ . 

Oliver Ocsenas and JÃ¼ri Reimand (2022) _in revision_.


Tutorials - Jupyter notebooks

* 1_BigWigtoWindow.ipynb - mapping chromatin signals to megabase-scale windows
* 2_MAFtoWindow.ipynb - mapping cancer mutations to megabase-scale windows
* 3_CA2M_RF.ipynb - random forest models of megabase-scale mutation burden, chromatin accessibility and replication timing
* 4_CA2M_RF_FeatureSelection_Tutorial.ipynb - selecting significant features predicting mutation rates
* 5_CA2M_RF_SHAPscores.ipynb - computing feature importance scores (SHAP)
* 6_CA2M_RF_EnrichedMutations_Tutorial.ipynb - detecting genomic regions with enriched mutations that are not explained by chromatin and replication timing alone
