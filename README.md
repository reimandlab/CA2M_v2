# Predicting regional mutation burden in cancer genomes using chromatin accessibility and replication timing

This repository includes source code and processed datasets for the study by Oliver Ocsenas and JÃ¼ri Reimand (2022) _Chromatin accessibility of primary human cancers ties regional mutational processes and signatures with tissues of origin_ . 


Tutorials - Jupyter notebooks

* CA2M_RF.ipynb - random forest models of megabase-scale mutation burden, chromatin accessibility and replication timing
* BigWigtoWindowTutorial.ipynb - mapping chromatin signals to megabase-scale windows
* MAFtoWindowTutorial.ipynb - mapping cancer mutations to megabase-scale windows

Tutorials/data - files needed for tutorials
